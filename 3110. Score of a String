"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode. 
This programm has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

While I was solving all the easy problems of the leetcode, they poured in a few more simple ones. 
Well, everything seems to be clear here, we translate it into code and summarize it.
