"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
So this program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

Initially I wrote a lot of code, but after some thought I managed to shorten it. The feeling is that this is almost always possible when you test two opposite conditions.
