"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

I wrote the solution in 5 minutes and spent another 40 debugging the edge cases. 
Then I tweaked the loop a bit and everything worked. 
It was a normal problem, I just got confused with the indexes for no apparent reason.
