"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time because "in" is O(n) and O(1) by space.

"in" is faster then re like 3 times!

P.S: I always forget that the pattern comes first and then the string or vice versa.
An easy way to remember: Pattern, String. P.S.
