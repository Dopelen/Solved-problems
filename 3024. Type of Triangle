"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n(log(n))) (but there are 3 elements comone -> O(1)) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

This task seems cool to me, they implicitly require checking for aspect ratio while the main question in the task is different.
