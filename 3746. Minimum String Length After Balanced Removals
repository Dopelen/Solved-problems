"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

If only A and B are in a string, they will inevitably be adjacent to each other. 
We can delete any two adjacent A and B. 
There is no limit on the number of operations — the length of the string after all deletions will be the number of characters that didn't find a pair to be deleted.
So the solution is simply the absolute difference in their frequencies.
