"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(2^(logâ‚‚k + 1))  complexity by time and O(k) by space.

An easy task for my birthday!
If you solve it by enumeration, then it's not difficult, literally in a few operations you can type 500 elements, and not even worry that this is a "head-on" solution.
