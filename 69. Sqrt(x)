"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(log(n)) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

They're asking me to write a binary search again!
True, to my shame I have to say that I still have problems understanding the search boundaries, when they should be turned on and when not.
I use the left index as the return value because we are asked to return the nearest integer, which is exactly l-1.
