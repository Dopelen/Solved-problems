"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.

This program has O(log(n))complexity by time and O(1) by space.

At first I wrote a solution by brute force, but it didnâ€™t work out in time.
Then I wrote a kinda...logarithmic one, it passed, but it was still slow.
My instinct told me there was a bettert solution here.
And i found it!
