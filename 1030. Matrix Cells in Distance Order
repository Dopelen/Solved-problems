"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(log(n*m(n*m))) complexity by time and O(n*m) by space.

A very incomprehensible task, the main difficulty of which is to understand what they want from you.

P.S: I need to repeat the breadth first search and solve a couple of problems on it
