"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
 This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1).

I was fiddling around and somehow simulating bits, although I just needed to go through the number of operations, and I clearly spent more effort than necessary.
If the number is odd, processing a bit requires a total of two operations: one to shift it to make the number even, and one to remove it later. 
For even numbers, we simply remove it.
