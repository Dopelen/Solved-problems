"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

Despite its apparent simplicity, this problem overwhelmed me.
I had a rough idea of ​​how we should track the infinity of the loop, but I didn't have the energy to work out the entire algorithm.
Too bad, the solution is beautiful.
