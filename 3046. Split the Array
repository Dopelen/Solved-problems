"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
I published the solution on the LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-the-array/solutions/5134435/1-pass-counter-o-n-time-o-n-space/

This program has O(n)complexity by time and O(n) by space.

Ultimately, we are only concerned with the number of unique elements in a row and those with more than two.
I like my Solution!
