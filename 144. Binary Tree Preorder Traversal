"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
This program have O(n) complexity by time and I belive uses extra space when passing a list between functions.

Task 145 is almost the same.
This task is about traversing a tree, you just need to remember the order of the traversal. In this case - preorder: root -> left -> right"""
