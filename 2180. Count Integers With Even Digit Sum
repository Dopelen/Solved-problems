"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(len(str(num))) complexity by time and O(the same) by space.

Solved the problem exactly half an hour longer due to num//2 instead of (num - 1)//2.
And that's equal to 25 minutes more than this task requires.
