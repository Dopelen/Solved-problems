"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

From the moment I realized that there were no leading zeros, the solution immediately came together, I wrote a five-line one, which worked, but then I decided to shorten it, made a bunch of mistakes and this chimera came out.
P.S: After I explained the solution to myself, I easily removed half of all the checks, so now itâ€™s not a chimera, but a beautiful solution!
