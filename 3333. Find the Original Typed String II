"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
So this program has O(n * k) complexity by time and O(n + k) by space.

I can't do it myself today
I still understood what they wanted from me, 20 minutes had already passed.
There is a final string, and there is a number K. We need to find the number of possible ways to compress the string from the original, into a string of size no less than k.
Not only does the solution with simple dynamic programming fail, it also fails with optimization.
BUT I'm not upset!
I'm glad that I at least understood what they wanted from me.
