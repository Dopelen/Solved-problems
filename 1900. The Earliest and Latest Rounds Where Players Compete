"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(1) complexity by time and O(log(n)) by space.

A very difficult task, the technique of which is far beyond my understanding. 
I could say that I roughly understood what needs to be achieved, but "how" to do it is an impossible task, perhaps even with an example.
