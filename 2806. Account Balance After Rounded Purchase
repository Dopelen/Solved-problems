"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(1) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

A fun puzzle, but not difficult. 
I just had to juggle the conditions. 
The result was output using the remainder of division by 10, but in general you can do this based on the length of the string, after converting the number to a string
