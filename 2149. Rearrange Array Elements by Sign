"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

The other day there was a similar task. 
If it is possible to use additional memory, it will always be clearer what you are doing if you use it. 
If there was a change in the requirements in place, we would have to do magic with pointers
