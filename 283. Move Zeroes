"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
This program have O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space

I tryed add some heuristics to speed up the work with some special input data, but this made the code overcomplicated, 
so I settled on such a simple implementation with the movement of two pointers"""
