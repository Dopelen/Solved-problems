"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
 This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n).

I decided to challenge myself, and ended up spending an hour writing a recursive version, incorrectly filling in the ends of words and, for some reason, also storing additional values ​​in the nodes themselves. 
Overall, it turned out very crooked, but then I thought about it and rewrote it iteratively and beautifully.
