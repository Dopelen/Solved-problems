"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

A simple problem involving two pointers. 
Donâ€™t forget to add another one to the answer, 
since we initialize the answer to zero, 
and also in intermediate answers we do not take into account the right border (but we should).
