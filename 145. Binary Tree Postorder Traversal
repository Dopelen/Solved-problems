"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
This program have O(n) complexity by time and I belive uses extra space when passing a list between functions.
I tried to solve this problem by save list for answer into the class,
which could have saved me from endlessly passing the list inside recursive functions, 
but for some reason in this case the leetcode validating system retained the value from the previous check between test cases

In general, this task is about traversing a tree, you just need to remember the order of the reverse traversal: left-right-root"""
