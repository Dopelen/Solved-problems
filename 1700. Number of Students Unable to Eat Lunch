"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
I posted this solution:
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-unable-to-eat-lunch/solutions/4943483/o-n-speed-o-1-space-solution-99-5/

This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

I caught the deadlock condition that needed to be caught and avoided endless iterations!
