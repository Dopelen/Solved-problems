"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
This program have O(n) complexity by time

At first I started 2 dictionaries, but then I realized that this was unnecessary. 
If the set of all values is not equal to 0, then the two given lines are not an anogram

I use trick with generate alphabet from char in range(97, 123) again, but idk how good and fast it is"""
