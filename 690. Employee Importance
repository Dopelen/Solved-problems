"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
 This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n).

A simple and enjoyable task, where instead of a tree, like a hierarchical graph, we write a simple traversal with the only difference that our class is called "Employee" and not "Node"
