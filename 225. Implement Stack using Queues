"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) for push() and O(1) for the rest complexity by time and O(number of push) by space.

Overall, it was a cool question, but it didnâ€™t really touch my heartstrings. 
Every time I have to go through the entire list to get one element, I feel a little sad
