"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n * sqrt(n)) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

The problem was unlike anything I'd solved before. 
I couldn't figure out how to approach it, and the hints weren't much help either.
Even after looking at the solution, it’s hard to wrap my head around; I’m not ready for that yet.
