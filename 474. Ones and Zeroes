"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(L + K * m * n) complexity by time and O(m * n) by space.

I started solving the problem greedily, but realized I needed dynamic programming.
The idea is to take or not take elements while maintaining the maximum number of rows in our dp array for the given m and n.
