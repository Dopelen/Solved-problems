"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
This program have O(1) complexity by time.

He-he. Goal is simple - find the color of a chessboard square, if it is white - return the truth.
I came up with a cool solution without the sad process of writing down each letter in the dictionary, 
but I couldnâ€™t achieve complete beauty in the implementation! So I'll leave my code here and some cooler code that does the same thing"""

# My code
class Solution:
    def squareIsWhite(self, coordinates):
        if (ord(coordinates[0])%2 == 0 and int(coordinates[1])%2 != 0) or (ord(coordinates[0])%2 != 0 and int(coordinates[1])%2 == 0):
            return True
        return False

# Code on steroids
class Solution:
    def squareIsWhite(self, c: str) -> bool:
        return (ord(c[0])+int(c[1]))%2
