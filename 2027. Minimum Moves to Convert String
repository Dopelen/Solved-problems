"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space. Where m is alphabet and n amount of words.

I'm glad that this problem can be solved as greedily as possible. 
If you have an "X" symbol, you must replace it. 
You can only do this by changing 3 symbols, then just swap all 3 symbols from the current location and shift the index!

P.S: And we don't even need to change anything in the line!
