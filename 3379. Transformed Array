"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

It's a cyclic array, so we'll use the remainder from the division.
Fortunately, we can reduce everything to a single check, because negative numbers will naturally be subtracted before taking the remainder, and positive numbers will be added.
A simple task, glad for a rest day after yesterday's difficult one.
