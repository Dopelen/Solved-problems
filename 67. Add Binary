"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(max(nums1, nums2)) complexity by time and O(max(nums1, nums2)) by space.

I had already written my bit calculator and only then did it dawn on me that I could convert it to the decimal system, perform the calculations and return it to binary.
