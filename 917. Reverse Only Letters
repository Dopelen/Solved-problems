"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

Fortunately, there is a method for identifying Latin letters. 
It would be possible to do this identification of characters by their ASCII code, 
but there is an interval between capitals and small ones from 90 to 97, 
which requires additional checking and this somehow affects the appearance of the code.
