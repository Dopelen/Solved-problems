"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

I'm just iterating through sequences. 
Some easy problems are more difficult than this one.

P.S: For some reason I always iterate through while instead of for, I need to break this habit!
