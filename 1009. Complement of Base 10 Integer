"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n).

I decided to make the task a simple iteration over a string, although the original idea was to simply invert the number. 
BUT SURPRISE - SURPRISE. 
In binary representation, the sign bit is also inverted, so I was not allowed to implement my two-character code.
