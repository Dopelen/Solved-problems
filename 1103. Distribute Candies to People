"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(the number of iterations we will have to do multiplied by the number of people) complexity by time and O(num_people) by space.

At first I wanted to solve using the sum of progressions, but I got confused and returned to the simple brute-force solution.
