"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This code has O(n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

I started solving a simplified version of yesterday's problem, but it turned out that something completely different was needed. 
As a result, I confused myself and made my life more difficult. 
The main task is to move each element to another place and calculate the maximum possible gap that can be obtained.
