"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

I quickly figured out that I needed to solve it using prefix sums, but then I froze, the moment with calculating the difference of these sums still baffles me.
I don't know if it's just today, or if this problem is based on 5 similar problems and is the final boss, but even after looking at the solution analysis and running the code, I can hardly understand how it works.
Essentially, we calculate the remainder from dividing a given prefix sum by a given number, and look for segments with the same remainder (by storing them in a dictionary) and, if there is a match, 
we calculate the length of the segment we need, through the difference in indices where the same remainder was encountered earlier.

I'm sure that this is not the end of the story, I have many more prefix sums and suffering with them waiting for me.

P.S: 30.11.2025 A year later, I figured it out. Great solution!
