"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n ** 3) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

I completed the problem in 2 minutes and then I was like, 
“Wait a minute, it should be solved faster using prefixes and suffixes” 
I sat for a whole hour on it and finally solved it, and it turned out that such a problem exists at the medium level! 
So I’ll post a quick solution there: 2874. Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet II
