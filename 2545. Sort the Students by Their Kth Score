"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n(log(n))) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

It is not often that you come across a simple syntax task among medium-level tasks. 
When you know the basic mechanism, you donâ€™t even have to think - you immediately see what needs to be written here.
