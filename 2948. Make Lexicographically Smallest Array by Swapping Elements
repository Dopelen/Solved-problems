"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n(log(n))) complexity by time and O(n(log(n))) by space.

I tried to solve it for an hour without hints, wrote 50 lines of code, got upset. I looked at the hints, it is solved through graphs or division into components with sorting, I can't figure out every task :(
