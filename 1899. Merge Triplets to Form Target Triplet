"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
 This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1).

The values ​​after comparisons can only increase, so we can iterate and search for the desired elements from those that are all less than or equal to the target values.
It's a beautiful solution, but it took some effort to get there.
