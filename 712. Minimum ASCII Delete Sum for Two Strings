"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n ** 2) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

I figured out that it was a longest common subsequence problem, but I couldn't come up with a dynamic programming solution for it, and I'm still having a lot of trouble with it.
