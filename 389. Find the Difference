"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
This program have O(sorting algorithm speed (O(n*log(n))probably)) complexity by time.

I wanted to add binary insertion here, but that would only work in the case of unique characters 
(because duplicate elements would prevent the element's insertion zone from being properly determined), but then using set would make more sense
Anyway, there is "just check every elem" alghoritm """
