"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
This program have O(bin(n))?O(1)? complexity by time

Im not sure about complexity, because I dont know the alghoritm behinde bitwise search. 
Some of bitwise search "1", "0' operation can be complite in O(1)
I don't know much about bit operations, so I'm just using the basic syntax."""
