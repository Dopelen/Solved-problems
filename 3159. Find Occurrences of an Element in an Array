"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

Quite a simple task, the complexity of which lies in its description. 
By the time you understand what they want from you, 20 minutes will have passed, besides, the "queries" array is 1-based, but obviosly in Solution you will be use 0-based.
Otherwise, the task is simple, beautifully solved with a couple of lines
