"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode. 
This programm has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

The structure of the condition hints to us that we can raise 1 or 2 symbols by one at a time. 
In this case, the minimum required number of operations is reduced to the maximum digit in number, since there is no way to get 5 except by adding "1" 5 times.
