"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
I'm creating a list with an answer, so in space it's at least O(n). I'll need to iterate over the original list and make n constant O(1) calls, so in time it's also O(n).

I did an almost identical task, and this time it was easier. But she still broke my brain again.
The hardest thing is to simplify the task. 
"Place in this position an element with the index that is currently in this position."
