"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on letcode.
I published the solution on the LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-the-sentence-is-pangram/solutions/4845221/the-solution-that-comes-to-mind-2-hours-later-while-brushing-your-teeth

This program has O(n)complexity by time and O(alphabet) by space.

I found questions about collection methods in one of the resumes, and now Iâ€™m trying to introduce them into my code, besides, they are very cool!
