"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n(log(n))) complexity by time and O(n).

I was extremely surprised that when using multiple sorting, you can specify ascending order for one element and descending order for another using the "-" sign.
Perhaps this can be solved per line, but sorting seems to be optimal
