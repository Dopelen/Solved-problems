"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(len(str(n))) complexity by time and O(possible symbols) by space.

Initially, I wanted to count some bits, and only then I realized that the problem was about numbers in the decimal system.

P.S: You can also solve by reducing numbers using remainders from division by 10, but this is more voluminous.
