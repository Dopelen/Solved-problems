"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) by time and O(n) by space.

I decided to add the lengths of words until I get the lentght of given one, and then check whether the already glued string of words matches the given one.
I like this solution because it works with word lengths and we don't have to constantly interact with string slices.
