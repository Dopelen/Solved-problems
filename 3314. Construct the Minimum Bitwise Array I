"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(1000 * n) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

The constraints allow you to simply iterate through all the values ​​without having to construct an answer.
I'll probably do that, because I have a feeling they'll force me to construct one tomorrow anyway.
