"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(log(n) * log(k)) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

Sunday, a difficult task with a success rate of 30...
It's going to be a gloomy day - I thought.
But then I saw that this was actually the task I solved yesterday, only with the "difficult" tag!
But then I saw that the limit is now 10 ** 9, so my solution won't work :(

If you take my code from yesterday (problem 386) and just modify it, even though there are no complex mathematical operations going on there, it doesn't pass in time.
Which makes me think that there is a clear pattern to the construction of this kind of series and we don't need to calculate all the numbers to pull out the k-th element.
If you break the problem down into parts, you can see that if we are given the number 100001, the first few elements will correspond to the numbers 
1, 10, 100, 1000... 10 ** i where i is the power of 10 that the number rests on, 
then all the elements that are needed to lower the current power of 10 by one + elements of powers of 10 lower that occur in the lexigraphic range.
If we take some "convenient" number, for example 999, we can notice that the numbers in it will be distributed evenly:
1, 10, 100, 11, 110, 111, 112... and at the end 9, 99, 990, 991...999
And even if the number is "inconvenient" like 1003, the "surplus" will be in some specific place that we can determine.
100, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003.
All that remains for us is to derive a formula that would help determine the distance between lexigraphic steps (how much we need to go from "1" to "2").
To do this, we use a function that would calculate the number of steps needed to move to the next lexigraphically larger order.
To go from 1 to 2, we need to take all the numbers from 10 to 100, from 100 to 1000, and so on, depending on the power of 10 we are working with.
