"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n * n) time complexity and O(n * n) by space.

I understood the task, but I'm so nervous about the interview that I can't figure out much. 
The code itself is not difficult, and the hints are good, but something just didn't work out today.
