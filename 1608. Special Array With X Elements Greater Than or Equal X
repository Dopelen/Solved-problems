"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n(log(n))) complexity by time and O(n) by space. 

For some reason it was very difficult for me to understand the condition of this problem, and I even took a hint, but in the end I won.
Used sorting to quickly find positions for an answer.
