"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n ** 2) complexity by time and O(n) by space.

At first I tried to write a cool solution in linear time using a stack or a queue, but I quickly ran into trouble and decided to simplify the task for myself by going head-on.
