"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(rows * cols) complexity by time and O(rows * cols) by space.

I understood the concept of the solution pretty quickly, but I couldn't write a full code even after several hours, and usually everything is exactly the opposite. Maybe it's because I'm sick now.
I got a 60-line version of infinite if loops, so it's embarrassing to even show it, so better enjoy this elegant solution.
