"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

I just spent two hours tinkering with a difficult problem I've already solved before, so I'm forced to look for a new one. Thankfully, I found a very simple one.
It's just an iterative search for integer divisors of a number. I don't know why I forgot this problem in the middle section.
