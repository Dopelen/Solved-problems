"""You can see the description of the task using the code specified in the title on leetcode.
This program has O(n) complexity by time and O(1) by space.

I started solving a polynomial, but ran into a strange error, and it dawned on me how to solve for a line using a back-to-front pass!
I was very confused about what order to do the checks in, but I got it in the end!
